    "Dynamic programming is a technique for solving a problem that involves dividing the problem into subproblems, solving each subproblem once and storing the answer in case we see the same subproblem again.\n",

    "We can do Dynamic Programming **top-down** or **bottom-up**, which I explain with the example of calculating the $n$-th Fibonacci number.\n",

    "## Naive approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $F_i$ be the $i$th Fibonacci number, where $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$ and $F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}$. Given some integer $n >= 1$, what is an algorithm for calculating $F_n$? The naive approach is the following recursive algorithm:"
