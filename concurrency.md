# Concurrency

A computer program is a sequence of instructions. We can execute 2 computer programs **sequentially** by first executing the instructions of one of the programs and then executing the instructions of the other program. Alternatively, we could execute the 2 computer programs **concurrently** by executing their instructions during overlapping time periods. For example, we could alternate executing instructions from each program so that the programs are executed over roughly the same time period. If we had 2 or more processing units capable of executing instructions, then we could also execute the 2 computer programs in **parallel** by executing the instructions of 1 program on 1 processing unit and the other program on another processing unit. If we execute the 2 programs in parallel, then the 2 programs would be executed during overlapping time periods, which makes parallel computing a special case of concurrent computing.
