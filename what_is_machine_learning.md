# What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the study and practice of building computer systems that learn to perform tasks by example rather than by explicit instructions.

**Example:** It is very difficult to write a computer program through explicit instructions that can perform the task of converting an image of a handwritten digit to the number it represents. But we can show a computer program many examples of images along with labels and have it learn a function that maps one to the other.
